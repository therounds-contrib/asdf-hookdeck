# Dependencies

This plugin depends on common POSIX utilities (`awk`, `head`, `grep`, `sed`,
`tar`, etc.), Bash, curl, and Git. Ideally all stuff you had to have installed
to get asdf working in the first place.

# Install

Plugin:

```shell
asdf plugin add hookdeck
# or
asdf plugin add hookdeck https://github.com/therounds-contrib/asdf-hookdeck.git
```

hookdeck:

```shell
# Show all installable versions
asdf list-all hookdeck

# Install specific version
asdf install hookdeck latest

# Set a version globally (on your ~/.tool-versions file)
asdf global hookdeck latest

# Now hookdeck commands are available
hookdeck version
```

Check [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) readme for more instructions on how to
install & manage versions.
